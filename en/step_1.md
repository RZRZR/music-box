## Introduction

### What you will do

This project will show you how to wire up buttons to your Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins and then use them to play sounds with a simple Python application.

### What you will learn

By creating a GPIO music box with your Raspberry Pi you will learn how to:

- Play sounds in Python with `pygame`
- Connect a button to the GPIO pins on a Raspberry Pi
- Use the Python `gpiozero` library to connect button presses to function calls
- Use the dictionary data structure in Python
- Ensure that your code can be easily extended, so that it is useful for other projects
