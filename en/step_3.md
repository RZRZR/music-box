## Play sounds

Next, you will start to write your Python code. You can use any text editor or IDE to do this â€” Mu is always a good choice.

To start to create the instruments of your music box, you need to test whether Python can play some of the samples that you have copied.

First, import and initialise the `pygame` module for playing sound files.

```python
import pygame

pygame.init()
```
--- /task ---

--- task ---
Save this file in your `gpio-music-box` directory.
--- /task ---

--- task ---
Choose four sound files that you want to use for your project, for example:

```
drum_tom_mid_hard.wav
drum_cymbal_hard.wav
drum_snare_hard.wav
drum_cowbell.wav
```
--- /task ---

--- task ---
Then, create a Python object that links to one of these sound files. Give the file its own unique name. For example:

```python
drum = pygame.mixer.Sound("/home/pi/gpio-music-box/samples/drum_tom_mid_hard.wav")
```
--- /task ---

--- task ---
Create named objects for your remaining three sounds.

Your `.wav` files are all in your `samples` directory, so the file path will look like this:
```python
"/home/pi/gpio-music-box/samples/filename.wav"
```
--- /hint --- --- hint ---
Each sound object must have a unique name. You could call the next one `cymbal`:
```python
cymbal = pygame.mixer.Sound("/home/pi/gpio-music-box/samples/drum_cymbal_hard.wav")
```
--- /hint --- --- hint ---
Here's what your code should look like:
```python
import pygame

pygame.init()

drum = pygame.mixer.Sound("/home/pi/gpio-music-box/samples/drum_tom_mid_hard.wav")
cymbal = pygame.mixer.Sound("/home/pi/gpio-music-box/samples/drum_cymbal_hard.wav")
snare = pygame.mixer.Sound("/home/pi/gpio-music-box/samples/drum_snare_hard.wav")
bell = pygame.mixer.Sound("/home/pi/gpio-music-box/samples/drum_cowbell.wav")
```
--- /hint --- --- /hints ---
--- /task ---

--- task ---
Save and run your code. Then, in the shell at the bottom of the Mu editor, use `.play()` commands to play the sounds.

```python3
drum.play()
```

--- /task ---

If you don't hear any sound, check that your speakers or headphones are working and that the volume is turned up.
