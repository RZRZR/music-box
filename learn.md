By creating a GPIO music box with your Raspberry Pi you will learn:

- How to play sounds in Python with PyGame
- How to connect a button to the GPIO pins on a Raspberry Pi
- How to use the Python GPIO Zero library to connect button presses to function calls
- How to use the dictionary data structure in Python
- How to ensure code is easy to extend a simple project to do more

This resource covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/):

- [Combine programming constructs to solve a problem](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/builder)
- [Combine inputs and/or outputs to create projects or solve a problem](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/physical-computing/builder)
- [Use basic materials and tools to create project prototypes](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/manufacture/creator)
